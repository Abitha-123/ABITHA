To celebrate the marriage flowers are used. So it is used everywhere.
All the economic factors lie in this table that what the consumers are required and they target a specific area.
Same as with political factors like government is well concerned with the environment and emphasizes to grow more plants which really helps in our florist business.
Social factor means the trend in which we are moving like flowers can be used for expressing something, attractiveness, nice essence and many more. So to get a single flower we should get many qualities. This will help our firm to improve and different from others business.
So I think that this firm is very much comfortable to have a good competition in the market.
